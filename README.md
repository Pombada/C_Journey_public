Here are most of the code that was made in lessons 1-6 on C,
You will find some functions that are connected to sorts and some that might be used in the course DAST 
& some of them are personal ideas that I currently work on.
However you will might notice that some of them are unfinished and they are marked as a comment for that matter.
Use what you need and may this tiny file be a beacon of light at the this darkest hour/
Good luck in your course (ignore all the street language i use in my commenting, I'm just unfiltered when it comes to my own codes).
